# Uber Data Analysis:
This Uber Data Analysis project aims to provide insights into ride-sharing usage patterns by analyzing trip data. The primary objectives are to distinguish trips based on their purpose (business or personal), examine the geographical patterns of start and stop locations, and conduct a time series analysis to observe trends
over time.

## Overview
This project involves analyzing Uber trip data to uncover patterns and insights regarding trip purposes, geographical trends, and temporal dynamics. The primary goals are to distinguish between business and personal trips, map out start and stop locations, and perform a time series analysis to understand usage trends over time.

## Motivation
The motivation for conducting the Uber Data Analysis project stems from the growing reliance on ride-sharing services and the potential to leverage data-driven insights for enhancing service delivery and user satisfaction.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.10.0. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Future Scope

* Advanced Predictive Analytics
* Real-time Analytics
* Enhanced Time Series Analysis
* Itegration with External Data Sources
